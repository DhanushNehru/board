## Getting Started

To run the project locally we need to setup google signin initially and need a local server like Python's HTTP server or Node.js.

### Setting Up Google Sign-In

1. **Create a Google Cloud Project:**
   - Visit the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Create new or select an existing project.

2. **Configure OAuth Consent Screen:**
   - In the Cloud Console, navigate to "APIs & Services" > "OAuth consent screen."
   - Configure the OAuth consent screen with the all required details like app name, user support email, etc..

3. **Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID:**
   - In the Cloud Console, go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials."
   - Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth client ID."
   - Choose the application type as Web application and add authorized JavaScript origins. ( eg. http://localhost and http://localhost:3000) 
   - Note the generated "Client ID."

4. **Set `data-client_id` in HTML from a JSON file:**
    - In config.json file replace the client_id with the copied value

### Running the Project

To run the project locally, you need a local server. Before that, make sure you have either Python or Node.js installed.

- **Python:** Run the project with Python's HTTP server using: `python -m http.server 3000`.
- **Node.js:** Start the project with `http-server` using: `npx http-server -p 3000`.

Ensure that the port number mentioned here matches the authorized JavaScript origins. If you have any doubts, refer to the [screenshots](https://github.com/DhanushNehru/board/pull/57) in the comments for additional assistance.
